						#######Arkadians mini project########



This mini project is a demonstration of how a fullstack project works it has two main components:

-backend:
assures connectivity to database (MongoDb dataBase on the cloud) Using a connection string and then execute functions on it:
-adding databases,Collections and Documents...
-Showing the data stored in a collection in a json format,and by making that data appear on a certain route 
we create our api that we use in our frontend.
-frontend: 
we use the frontend in this mini project to preview data from the database, that data is fetched and put in containers.
